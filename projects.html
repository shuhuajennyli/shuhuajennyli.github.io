            <p>
                Employed machine learning techniques to classify ECG heartbeats into five categories of cardiac arrhythmia. Using Python, developed and meticulously refined a 9-layer CNN, exploring over 20 model architectures. The final model demonstrated cardiologist level accuracies with 97% of unhealthy cases classified as unhealthy and 98% of healthy cases classified as healthy. Recognized by Youth Science Canada.
